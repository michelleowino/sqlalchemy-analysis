# sqlalchemy-analysis

Congratulations! You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. The following sections outline the steps taken to accomplish this task. 

## Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
I used Python and SQLAlchemy to do a basic climate analysis and data exploration of your climate database. Specifically, SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib. 
I performed a precipitation analysis and station analysis and designed various queries. 

## Part 2: Design Your Climate App
I designed a Flask API based on the queries developed.

### 12 months of precipitation data
